# AirPort-Simulation_Arrival_Departure

Only one plane can be served in any unit of time. So either a plane can land or a plane can takeoff not both. Since waiting in the air might lead to disasters, arrivals have higher priority than the departing planes.Only when the landing list is empty, is a departing plane allowed to takeoff. Planes canâ€™t be queued for too long while waiting to land. This means there is a capacity limit on the landing list. When this list is full arriving planes must be directed to another airport. The simulation of the airport should keep track of how long a landing or departing plane waits in the line before landing or departing. It should also keep track of how many arriving flights are directed to another airport. The simulation should keep track of the number of planes that requested landing and the number that are accepted, and the number that are landed. All requests for depar- tures will be accepted and served in the order in which they requested the service. At the end of simulation, you need to find the total number of planes served, the average rate of planes wanting to land per unit time, the average rate of planes wanting to depart per unit time, the average wait in the landing line, and the average wait in the departing line in time units.
